# Structural Typing for Rust

Defining structs that share similar data can get repetitive. This is an experiment to allow defining structs that can have some of the fields missing.

The main inspirations for attempting this are typescript, RDF and [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5WdGrpoug&list=PLZdCLR02grLrEwKaZv-5QbUzK0zGKOOcr&index=2&t=9s)

## How does it work?

For now, take a look at [lib.rs](https://github.com/Crazytieguy/structural-typing-rs/blob/master/src/lib.rs) to get an idea. Rust docs are on the way.
